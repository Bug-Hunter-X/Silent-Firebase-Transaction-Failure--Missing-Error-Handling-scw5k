# Silent Firebase Transaction Failure in Firebase
This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in Firebase transactions: the silent failure of a transaction due to missing error handling. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with robust error handling.

## Problem
The initial code attempts a Firebase transaction but lacks a `catch` block to handle potential errors. If the transaction fails (e.g., due to a network issue or concurrent modifications), it won't throw an error, leading to unexpected data inconsistencies and difficult debugging.
